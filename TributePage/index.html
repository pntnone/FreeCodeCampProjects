            instructor, actor, director, screenwriter, producer, and
            philosopher.He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial
            arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is
            often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts
            (MMA). Lee is considered by critics, media, and other martial
            artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a
            pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between
            East and West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema
            and helping to change the way Asians were presented in American
            films.
